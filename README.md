## Complete guide for using this repo

This repository is a structured academic project designed to bridge theoretical foundations and computational implementation in Signals and Systems.

It contains:

- `Educational-Resources/` — Core theoretical references used in the course  
- `python-notebooks/` — Python implementations aligned with course chapters  

The objective is to translate theory into verified computational understanding.

1. **Clone the Repository**

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/signals-and-systems-hut.git
cd signals-and-systems-hut
```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    Activate it:

    **Windows:**
    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    **macOS / Linux:**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Required Dependencies**

    If a `requirements.txt` file exists:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Otherwise install the required scientific stack manually:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy scipy matplotlib sympy jupyter
    ```

    These libraries support:
    *   Continuous-time and discrete-time convolution
    *   Fourier Series and Fourier Transform
    *   Laplace Transform and Z-Transform
    *   Sampling and filtering
    *   LTI system simulation

4.  **Run the Notebooks**

    Start Jupyter:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    Then navigate to:
    ```
    python-notebooks/
    ```

    Select the appropriate chapter folder and run notebook cells sequentially. Execution order must be preserved to ensure reproducibility.

5.  **Recommended Study Workflow**

    For effective use of the repository:
    1.  Study the theoretical material inside `Educational-Resources/`
    2.  Understand the mathematical derivations
    3.  Open the corresponding notebook inside `python-notebooks/`
    4.  Compare equations with implementation
    5.  Modify parameters and observe system behavior

    This enforces the learning pipeline:
    **Theory → Mathematical Formulation → Computational Implementation → Conceptual Understanding**

6.  **Keep Your Repository Updated**

    Before starting new work:
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

    This ensures synchronization with the latest changes.

7.  **Contribution Workflow**

    This repository evolves through structured academic contributions.

    **Step 1 — Fork the Repository**
    Create your own fork on GitHub.

    **Step 2 — Clone Your Fork**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/signals-and-systems-hut.git
    cd signals-and-systems-hut
    ```

    **Step 3 — Create a Feature Branch**
    Do not work directly on `main`.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/chapter-xx-topic
    ```
    Use descriptive branch names aligned with the course syllabus.

    **Step 4 — Add or Improve Notebooks**
    Place notebooks inside the correct directory:
    ```
    python-notebooks/<chapter-folder>/
    ```

    Each notebook must include:
    *   Clear theoretical introduction
    *   Correct mathematical implementation
    *   Structured and readable code
    *   Properly labeled figures
    *   No redundant or unnecessary content

    **Step 5 — Commit Changes**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add notebook for DT Fourier Transform properties"
    ```
    Use precise and technical commit messages.

    **Step 6 — Push Your Branch**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/chapter-xx-topic
    ```

    **Step 7 — Open a Pull Request**
    Submit a Pull Request to the `main` branch of `signals-and-systems-hut`. Include a clear description of:
    *   The implemented topic
    *   The corresponding chapter
    *   Any assumptions or design decisions
